### FPGA Playground

Just some Verilog example snippets for learning how FPGAs work. They are meant
to be run on a BlackIce-II ICE40HX8K development board. The PCFs all refer to
pins on that chip and some of the files use the sram example from that repo
(https://github.com/mystorm-org/BlackIce-II)

The main thing I'm working on (as of this commit) is a vga core.
